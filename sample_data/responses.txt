I needs ~friends~
It sounds like the cutest thing ever
I love to empower and uplift others and make others feel loved, especially all my ladies!
Need to be around a group of motivated women and stepping outside of my comfort zone :)
Bad Ass Women Support Bad Ass Women
I love a group of strong women supporting each other!! we all need it!
I would like to meet and make friends with some likeminded women who like to have fun and support each other and each others goals.
Always down to connect with other inspiring females
Being around a group of women with the express goal of both lifting each other up and pushing each other forward sounds amazing and like something I need in my life.
I just moved back to Reno from Arizona and am really needing some girls to do anything with. Also love the concept and love to support things like this‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Life as an entrepreneur can get lonely, especially during the time we‚Äôre in! I would love to meet new people to encourage and be encouraged.
My gal pal circle is super tiny (there are three of us) and I‚Äôve been wanting to connect with more girls and make myself vulnerable in building new friendships. I also want to support other gals/be supported in life changes and collaborate on different goals, ideas, etc!
I would love to meet more empowering and incredible girls in the Reno community. Growing up here I‚Äôve had a bit of a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù and it would be great to reach out and meet some new girls!! Also my incredible best friend is doing this and I will 10000% support and participate in every aspect of what she does
I love being part of an empowering and passionate group of women that help each other grow and learn
A community of girls supporting each other toward our aspirations in life, sounds great! I think women supporting women is a must.
I would love to meet some cool new friends
It seems like a fun way to get connected with the Reno community!
I would love to be apart of a driven group of women in order to keep me motivated and inspired!
This is such a cool idea and seems like so much fun! I love meeting new people and making new girlfriends! During these weird times it can be hard to meet new, fun people so I think this is a great idea. :)
Natalie and I were in a women‚Äôs circle together six years ago and I miss having a women‚Äôs group.
I love empowering other and creating new memories with amazing people! This will help me grow as an individual and allow me to help others in whatever ways I know how. I think we all are amazing and can bring something new to the table
I don‚Äôt have enough good girl friends and would love to meet new peopleü•∫
I would love to be active in spreading love and kindness to the woman in the area! I love this town! I just want to connect and make girly friends for life
I love meeting new people and sitting down, having a glass of wine, and just really getting to know people with a little bit of liquid luck in ya;)
One of my favorite quotes is: Strong Women. May we know them. May we raise them. May we be them.
We have been so ingrained by society to be pitted against each other; to judge, to compete and to hate. We need to stop the cycle and become stronger women, together. My friends and I are all about uplifting one another with our careers, education, relationships, self love, ext. and to be able to continue the mission on a larger scale is an incredible opportunity that I would love to be apart of.
